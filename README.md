<p>
  I am <b>Nishant</b>, into Technical Operations by profession at Amazon, a content writer in side and currently figuring out stuff to try my hands at development.
<br>Really curious and swayed by culture carried by open and inclusive tech communities and also curious towards sharing things in public.
<br>Love to learn more about current trends in technologies and am particularly interested in AWS and Linux. Also believe in learning from others.
